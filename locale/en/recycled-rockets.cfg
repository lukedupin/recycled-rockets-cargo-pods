cargo-pod=Enables recycled rockets. Cargo pods are now required to drop materials from space. Reusable booster stages can be re-fueled with rocket fuel. Enables a new refueling rocket silo.
nuclear-rocket-ship=Optionally enables advanced rocket fuel. Each fuel is created using the unique characteristics for each planet. This enables nuclear powered rocket fuel. Ideal for Navis, created in the Centrifuge.
vulcanus-rocket-ship=A sulfur/calcite advanced rocket fuel. Ideal for Vulcanus. Created in the foundry.
recycled-mag-rocket-ship=A electromagnetic advanced rocket fuel. Ideal for Fulgora. Created in the electromagnetic plant.
recycled-bio-fuel=A biological advanced rocket fuel. Ideal for Gleba. Created in the bio lab.
recycled-cryo-rocket-ship=A cryogenic advanced rocket fuel. Ideal for Aquilo. Created in the cryogenic plant.

recycled-rocket-ship=Recyclable rocket that can be reused cargo pods and requires less fuel because tungsten is used in the construction of the rocket.
recycled-mag-heavy-fuel=A simplified lightweight electromagnetic fuel recipe.
